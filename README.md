COLMAP
======

About
-----

COLMAP is a general-purpose Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) pipeline with a graphical and command-line interface. It offers a wide
range of features for reconstruction of ordered and unordered image collections.
The software is licensed under the new BSD license.

The latest source code is available at https://github.com/colmap/colmap. COLMAP
builds on top of existing works and when using specific algorithms within
COLMAP, please also cite the original authors, as specified in the source code,
and consider citing relevant third-party dependencies (most notably
ceres-solver, poselib, sift-gpu, vlfeat).

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download pre-built binaries or build from source.
2. Download one of the provided [sample datasets](https://demuc.de/colmap/datasets/)
   or use your own images.
3. Use the **automatic reconstruction** to easily build models
   with a single click or command.

Sequential Track Provenance Workflow
------------------------------------

This branch can annotate a sequential-matcher database with per-inlier track
provenance for global SfM. The workflow is intentionally split into separate
database stages, so an existing verified database can be reused without
rerunning feature extraction, matching, or geometric verification.

First create the normal COLMAP database. This step is LC-free unless
track provenance is explicitly enabled:

```bash
DATASET_PATH=/path/to/project

colmap feature_extractor \
    --database_path "$DATASET_PATH/database.db" \
    --image_path "$DATASET_PATH/images"

colmap sequential_matcher \
    --database_path "$DATASET_PATH/database.db" \
    --SequentialMatching.use_track_provenance 0
```

Then derive track provenance as a separate in-place database update. Pass the
same `SequentialMatching` options that were used for the sequential matcher
step, especially overlap, loop-detection, and vocabulary-tree options:

```bash
cp "$DATASET_PATH/database.db" "$DATASET_PATH/database_track_provenance.db"

colmap track_provenance \
    --database_path "$DATASET_PATH/database_track_provenance.db"
```

Finally run mapping from the augmented database. No earlier stage has to be
recomputed:

```bash
mkdir -p "$DATASET_PATH/sparse"

colmap global_mapper \
    --database_path "$DATASET_PATH/database_track_provenance.db" \
    --image_path "$DATASET_PATH/images" \
    --output_path "$DATASET_PATH/sparse" \
    --GlobalMapper.track_lc_second_pass 1 \
    --GlobalMapper.gp_use_lc_observations 1 \
    --GlobalMapper.gp_lc_loss_type CAUCHY \
    --GlobalMapper.gp_lc_loss_scale 1.0 \
    --GlobalMapper.gp_lc_loss_weight 0.2
```

`track_provenance` only rewrites `two_view_geometries`: direct consecutive
pairs remain tracking/non-LC, transitive inliers remain non-LC, and the
remaining inliers in generated non-direct pairs are marked as LC. The augmented
database can be reused directly by later mapper runs. In `global_mapper`,
`track_lc_second_pass` keeps LC matches out of regular track union-find and
adds them later as LC observations. `gp_use_lc_observations` makes global
positioning consume those LC observations, and `gp_lc_loss_*` sets their
separate robust loss. The LC geometry loss values above mirror the first
global-positioning pass in the VideoSfM config this logic was transferred from.
