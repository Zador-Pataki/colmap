// Inputs:
//   * ``valid_pair_ids``: image pairs to iterate. Native callers pass
//     ``pose_graph.ValidEdges() | keys``; fork callers pass the subset of
//     ``view_graph.image_pairs`` with ``is_valid==true``.
//   * ``corr_graph``: ``ExtractMatchesBetweenImages`` reads the inlier
//     matches stored as ``flat_corrs`` (already filtered to RANSAC inliers
//     by the geom-verify step).
//   * ``image_id_to_keypoints``: per-image 2D keypoints used for the
//     intra-image consistency check.
//   * ``options``: the three thresholds above.
//   * ``ignore_match``: optional. When non-null and returns true for a
//     match, that match is skipped in the union-find phase.
